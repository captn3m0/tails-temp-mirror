[[!meta title="Persistent Storage"]]

If you start Tails from a USB stick, you can create an encrypted
Persistent Storage in the free space left on the USB stick.
The files and settings stored in the Persistent
Storage are saved encrypted and remain available across different working sessions.

You can use this Persistent Storage to store, for example:

  - Personal files
  - Some settings
  - Additional software
  - Encryption keys

The Persistent Storage is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase
on the USB stick.

After you create a Persistent Storage, you can choose to unlock it or not
each time you start Tails.
